# Discord Bot Website

I've made this template so every discord bot developer can use a website for it. The theme itself is supposed to be very simple and not advanced.

The site itself is not close at being finished. I still have a lot to finish like for an example:
- Dashboard
- Custom pages
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages

But I love working on the project, however if no one will use it I'll just mark is as discontinued. By starring this project I know you guys love it and want me to keep on working on it!

## UPDATES!
- Added a template of a dashboard I'm working on. It is not responsive yet.
- Added a spin animation!!! YAYY


## Features

- Dark and light mode will come soon!
- No credits required.
- 24/7 Support.
- Open source.
- Dashboard included.

## FAQ

#### Can I remove the footer?

Yes! I do not need any credits and you wont be copyright striked for using any of my projects.

#### Can I change color schemes and add more pages?

Of course.

#### When will you finish the entire site?

I'm not sure, it may take me around 7-11 months.


## ðŸ›  Skills you may need in the future...
